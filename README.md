## INTRODUCTION
### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that categorizes online shopping transactions into certain categories and clusters. Based on machine learning and clustering techniques, the model will allow companies to uncover hidden patterns, make inventory management problems easier, improve customer segmentation, and improve sales forecasts.

## DATASET OVERVIEW
The dataset used in this project is online retail transactions and contains the following primary columns:

- **InvoiceNo:** Unique transaction code.
- **StockCode:** Unique product code.
- **Description:** Name of product.
- **Quantity:** Units purchased.
- **InvoiceDate:** Date and time of transaction.
- **UnitPrice:** Cost per unit of product.
- **CustomerID:** Unique customer code (few missing values).
- **Country:** Country in which transaction was made.

## DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT
### Identified Issues

**Missing Values:**
- 1,454 missing values in the Description column.
- 135,080 missing values in the CustomerID column.

**Negative Values:**
- 10,624 negative values in the Quantity column (indicating product returns).
- 2 negative values in the UnitPrice column.
  
**Zero Values:**
- 2,515 zero values in the UnitPrice column.
- Special Characters and Blanks:
- Special characters and blank values in the Description column.
  
**Duplicate Rows:**
- 5,268 duplicate rows.
  
**Unspecified Entries:**
- Some rows in the Country column had "unspecified" entries.
  
## Rectifying Issues
**Handling Missing Values:**
- CustomerID: Missing values were handled using forward fill.
- Description: Missing values were identified and handled.
  
**Removing Negative and Zero Values:**
- Removed negative Quantity values (product returns).
- Removed negative UnitPrice values and invalid entries.
- Filtered out zero UnitPrice values.
  
**Renaming "Unspecified" Country:**
- "Unspecified" country entries were renamed to "Unknown" for clarity.
  
**Removing Duplicates:**
- Dropped 5,268 duplicate rows to ensure data accuracy.
  
**Standardizing Product Descriptions:**
- Renamed the Description column to Product for consistency.

## TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
- **Excel** for initial data exploration and anomaly detection.
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Prophet).
- **Jupyter Notebook** for visualization and analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression.
- **Clustering Techniques:** K-Means Clustering.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Facebook Prophet to predict sales.

**Daily Purchase Trend**
- Highest sales occur on Tuesday and Thursday, with peaks above 2 million.
- Sales drop significantly on Saturday, reaching near zero, which suggests minimal or no transactions on this day.
- Sales slightly recover on Sunday but remain lower compared to weekdays.
- Overall, weekdays have higher sales than weekends, indicating that most transactions happen during the workweek.

**Period Of The Day Purchase Trends**
- Afternoon has the highest sales, peaking around 6 million.
- Morning follows closely, with sales above 4 million.
- Sales drop significantly in the evening, suggesting fewer transactions.
- Night has the lowest sales, almost negligible, indicating little to no business activity.

**Monthly Purchase Trend**
- Slow Start: Sales are relatively low in January and February, with fluctuations in the first half of the year.
- Steady Growth: Sales pick up from May to August, though with slight variations.
- Peak Season: Significant sales increase from September onward, peaking in November and Decemberâ€”likely due to holiday shopping.
- Possible Strategy: Capitalizing on peak months (November-December) with promotions and stock optimization could maximize revenue.
